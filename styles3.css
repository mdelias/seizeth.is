 * I hope you enjoyed this.
 *
 * Thanks to Jake Albaugh, who was the first (that I know of) to do
 * a page like this. Some of the autotyping and syntax highlighting
 * code is based off his work.
 *
 * See more of Jake's work at http://codepen.io/jakealbaugh/
 *
 * This site borrows heavily from Samuel Reed's strml.net,
 * we made minor changes and tried not to break things.

*********************************************************************
 * We will need pandoc to print our BIP39 wordlist with
 * NFT backgrounds.
 * 
 * Install it for your system: https://pandoc.org/installing.html
 *
 * Ensure your installation has tex installed and 
 * that you can print PDFs.
 *
 * You may need to install missing packages:
 *
 * If your installation complains about everypage.sty
 * https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z-a-f/template-LaTeX/master/include/packages/everypage/everypage.sty
 *
 * Also install the background package
 * https://www.ctan.org/pkg/background
 *
 ***********Create the following shell script md2pdf.sh***********
 ** #!/bin/bash
 **
 **pandoc "$1" \
 **    -f gfm \
 **    --include-in-header header.tex \
 **    -V linkcolor:blue \
 **    -V geometry:a4paper \
 **    -V geometry:margin=0.5cm \
 **  --pdf-engine=xelatex \
 **    -o "$2"
 *
 ***********Create the following header.tex***********
 *
 **\usepackage{background}
 **\usepackage{xcolor}
 **
 **\backgroundsetup{
 **scale=1,
 **opacity=1,
 **angle=0,
 **pages=all,
 **contents={%
 ** \includegraphics[width=\paperwidth,height=\paperheight]{YOURNFT.jpg}
 ** }%
 **}
 **
 **\color{white}
***********Make custom edits to seize.txt***********
* The wordlist will remain readable on as few as four 8 1/2" x 11" pages
* You can use a converter to edit the markdown table in native csv
* if you want to rearrange the columns.
